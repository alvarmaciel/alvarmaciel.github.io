Why do they ask us to authorize things? Why do they block us if we don't? Should we authorize or not? This was a question from a neighbor last week, and I think we need to separate the problems, make them smaller, and start answering from there.

Websites ask you for authorization to install cookies due to data protection regulations. In Argentina, we have Law 25.326, which recognizes and regulates our rights regarding personal data.

Even so, cookies are there, on the web, and every time a banner appears warning us about them, it's likely that we click "accept" without giving it much thought.

This acceptance allows for a smoother experience on the website... But nothing is free in this virtual world; the cost is often the accumulation of data by companies for profiling purposes, primarily for advertising.

There are alternatives, yes:

- Use browsers that prioritize privacy: Firefox and Brave are good examples.
- Install browser extensions, such as Ublock Origin.
