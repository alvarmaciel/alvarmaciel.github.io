I am interested in many things, such as education and its relationship with technology, programming and its paradigms, the history and architecture of solutions to implementation problems, philosophy and the reflection on the impacts of radical innovations in our world, and mathematics and its methods of understanding the world. These are my most intense areas of interest. I am somewhat disorganized in learning and am constantly working to be more systematic. Even so, today I am much more efficient than in previous years.

### Formal and Informal Studies:
- Technician in computing.
- Primary School Teacher.
- Attendee of many online programming courses, with those from [10 pines](https://www.10pines.com/) being the most enriching.

### Learnings from my jobs

Without order of relevance and in broad strokes:
- Aulas en red allowed me to learn how to work with people who had never used technology to teach.
- My years as a teacher taught me to prioritize my work tasks based on clear objectives.
- Maestro Más Maestro taught me to always seek alternatives for literacy based on the students I encountered.
- Fundación Sadosky taught me to coordinate teams, write content, and work remotely.
- Shiphero taught me to program, both alone and with others, create stable products, and tackle production issues from multiple angles.

### Talks:

At one time, I gave many talks. Today, the deeper I delve, the less I have to say:

- 2020. School regroupings during accompanied promotion. Normal 7 Lecture Series.
