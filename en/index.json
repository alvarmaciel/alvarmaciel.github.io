Why do they block us if we don\u0026rsquo;t authorize? Should we authorize or not? This was a question from a neighbor last week, and I think we need to break down the issues, make them smaller, and start answering from there. Essentially, there are two major types of requests: those related to websites and those related to mobile applications. The former generally do not affect browsing, while the latter can indeed affect the use of an app.\nWhy do some pages ask me for permissions? # Web pages ask you to authorize cookies due to data protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States. These laws aim to protect users\u0026rsquo; privacy and ensure that companies are transparent about how they collect and use personal data. The application of these laws depends on various factors, in the case of the GDPR. A webpage must comply with the GDPR if:\nThe company processes personal data and is based in the EU, regardless of where the data is actually processed. The company is based outside the EU but processes personal data related to offering goods or services to citizens in the EU or monitors the behavior of EU citizens. Examples of a website targeting EU citizens:\nThe site is available in European languages. It accepts payments in euros or uses European payment systems. It advertises products or services to consumers in the EU. What are personal data? # Personal data is any information related to an identified or identifiable person, also known as \u0026ldquo;the data subject.\u0026rdquo; Examples of personal data include:\nFull name Address ID/passport number Income Cultural profile Internet Protocol (IP) address Data held by hospitals or doctors (identifying a person solely for healthcare purposes) What is the situation in our country? # In Argentina, we have Law 25.326. What rights does this law recognize regarding my personal data? The law recognizes your right to:\nHave your personal data not be used or recorded without your consent. Request and receive information about what personal data of yours is recorded in public or private databases. Request that your data be corrected or updated. Request that it be deleted, where applicable. Request that it be kept confidential. Initiate legal action to know your data or demand its correction, deletion, confidentiality, or updating. Is my consent always necessary for a database to include my personal data? # Yes, except when:\nYour data was obtained from publicly accessible sources. Your data was collected for the exercise of functions of state authorities or due to a legal obligation. Your data is in listings that are limited to details like name, national identity document, tax or pension identification, occupation, date of birth, and address. Your data was obtained through a contractual, scientific, or professional relationship and is necessary for its development or fulfillment. The operations are carried out by financial entities and involve information they receive from their clients. A public body that obtained your data in the exercise of its functions transfers it to another public body for a purpose within its functions. But honestly, I am not sure if it is mandatory for sites operating in Argentina to apply for authorization.\nAuthorizations on mobile phones # Now, authorizations on mobile phones must comply with the same rule. However, there\u0026rsquo;s a difference here. Many times, what we\u0026rsquo;re asked to authorize are functionalities, such as using the camera or accessing contacts. In many cases, if we don\u0026rsquo;t accept them, the app doesn\u0026rsquo;t work as it should, even if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t need that specific functionality. By accepting these accesses, companies comply with the law, inform you that they will access and use them, and thus we authorize our data to reside in their databases. And as we discussed last week, this is the fuel that powers the digital world\u0026rsquo;s economic engine: our data. So, what can we do? Not accept cookies. Reflect on the permissions we give to our mobile apps and stay informed.

How do we figure out which foods and their combinations are good, and how should we go about evaluating the same for the everyday apps that ultimately impact my mind and body? This is the proposal: to reflect and explore together how things work, so that later, each person can decide. We are going to start with something that surrounds us and is part of our everyday life.\nGoogle.\nGoogle belongs to a conglomerate of companies called Alphabet, and almost 90 percent of the revenue for this conglomerate comes from Google. To give us an idea, the combined profits of these companies are equivalent to the GDPs of some countries\u0026hellip; but with much fewer people involved, approximately 100,000. Google is not just the search engine, the browser, where I store my photos, the email I use to connect to other things, the operating system of my phone, my tablet, YouTube and the videos I watch, or the lives I want to live, the repository of my personal photos and videos, shared files and documents. All the contacts on my phone. The places I visit, the people I see, the time I spend in each place. What my child studies, how they study, and how well they are doing. Their age, what we like, what we don\u0026rsquo;t, the shows they watch. What we buy, what we want to buy, how much money we spend, how much I roughly earn. What my car is, the politician or policy I like, the party I dislike. My favorite football team, what I did 20 years ago, when I got drunk, what I thought 15 years ago, and what I think now.\nA lot, isn‚Äôt it?\nTo start unraveling this, it is important to know that, initially, Google is not what it portrays. This is one of those companies that, as we mentioned, concentrates wealth like small countries. And make no mistake, it‚Äôs not that I don\u0026rsquo;t use their products. It‚Äôs that I prefer an honest relationship with them. It becomes difficult to think about how they will carry out their slogan \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t be evil\u0026rdquo; within the business model that sustains them. The narrative of the lone inventor in a garage is beautiful, but it is dishonest to let us assume that this is the company we face today.\nPerhaps they started that way, but at some point in their growth, they had to decide between growing or perishing, and growth has a cost. These companies grew based on investments. That means companies, the state, and individuals lent them money in exchange for sharing the profits. Therefore, the company‚Äôs direction is no longer free from pressure because the money invested must yield returns. Thus, objectives change, and the market logic, that is, to produce profit, guides the course.\nAnd what did Google sell most to generate such high profit margins? Advertising. Google understood early on that the internet is a medium of communication, and in those media, it is advertising that sustains them. At this point, I want to pause and read what Esteban Magnani tells us in \u0026ldquo;The Comfort Cage.\u0026rdquo;\nBy selling advertising, Google survived the dot-com crisis. Now then, advertising‚Äîhow does that work? How do you make money selling ads? Well, it‚Äôs because the medium and how to reach consumers changed radically. What would happen if we knew what each person wanted and needed? If we could offer each individual just what they were looking for or desiring. If we could provide a service through which the butcher\u0026rsquo;s ad reaches the person who wants to have a barbecue.\nWell, this is what it\u0026rsquo;s about but on a global scale. That‚Äôs how it grew, by knowing and segmenting more and more effectively to whom each ad should be shown. A simple idea, but one that, at the same time, forever changed how we inhabit the world. This is just a thread of a tangled web with many loose ends.\n","date":"16 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/como_funcionan_las_cosas/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI think its importance lies in the fact that this knowledge allows us to decide.
